# Information

San Diego deserves better! The LOSSAN railway is a vital link between San Diego and Los Angeles (and beyond). Currently, trains traveling along the railway are exposed to catastrophic failure on the unstable and collapsing bluffs in Del Mar. While hundreds of millions have been poured into stop-gap solutions, a tunnel is being planned to ensure long term stability. However, local interest groups and freight railroads have opposed the tunnel and are threatening to make it too small to ensure future electrification. 

Medium and long term, electrification will be a humungous improvement to service, and we need to ensure the tunnel gets built with a: a good alignment, and b: space for electrification. Same story for the planned Miramar Hill tunnel which adds a station at UTC while skipping a very circuitous alignment.

Additionally, planned new stations at Camp Pendleton, Del Mar Fairgrounds, UTC, and Balboa Avenue will transform the utility of the Coaster.

- **Resiliency**: The Del Mar Tunnel will ensure the critical railway doesn't fall into the ocean.
- **Speed**: Del Mar and Miramar Hill tunnels will shave 15 minutes off the existing route, speeding up trips for everyone.
- **New Stations**: New stations at Camp Pendleton, Del Mar Fairgrounds, UTC, and Balboa Avenue help ensure that the Coaster is useful for everybody and enhance connectivity.
- **Future Electrification**: We must ensure that the new tunnels will be compatible with electrification.

Dear SANDAG Board Members,

I am writing as a resident of {{your_neighborhood}} to urge SANDAG to upgrade the LOSSAN corridor without hindering it. SANDAG must ensure that the Del Mar Tunnel gets built with the fastest and cheapest alignment, that the Del Mar and Miramar Hill tunnels get built with enough clearance to ensure future electrification, and that stations get built at Camp Pendleton, Del Mar Fairgrounds, UTC, and Balboa Avenue urgently.

San Diego deserves better. Coaster has incredible potential to shift the modal share of San Diego trips, but it's desperately missing a few already planned upgrades to get there. Please prioritize the two vital tunnels (Del Mar and Miramar Hill), new stations (Camp Pendleton, Del Mar Fairgrounds, UTC, Balboa Avenue), and electrification.

These upgrades would transform the utility of Coaster into a transit powerhouse, serving as a speedy regional backbone for transit trips that can be faster than driving.

I urge you to deliver these upgrades as quickly and cheaply as possible.

Thank you for your time and consideration of community input.

Sincerely,

{{your_name}}
