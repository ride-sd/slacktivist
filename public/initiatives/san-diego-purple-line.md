# Information

SANDAG promised San Diego a transformative heavy rail Purple Line in 2021—just 38 minutes from the border to Sorrento Valley, connecting our biggest job centers, universities, and transit-dependent neighborhoods. Now they want to cut it in half, ending at Snapdragon Stadium and leaving out the destinations that matter most.

What we're losing:

- **UCSD** - San Diego's largest university with 40,000+ students
- **Sorrento Valley** - The region's biggest job center with 65,000+ employees
- **Convoy District** - A thriving business and restaurant hub
- **Fast connections** - 38-minute trips from border to jobs, 8 minutes City Heights to Convoy

What they're offering instead: Freeway widening disguised as "managed lanes"—guaranteeing more traffic on an already gridlocked 805 corridor.
San Diego is too big, too spread out, and too expensive to settle for half-measures. We deserve the full line we were promised. Demand SANDAG restore the complete Purple Line route.

Dear SANDAG Board Members,

I am writing to urge you to restore the Purple Line to its original 2021 vision: a heavy rail line running from San Ysidro to Sorrento Valley.

The current scaled-back proposal—a light rail line ending at Snapdragon Stadium—does not serve San Diego's needs. By cutting out UCSD, Sorrento Valley, and Convoy, you are eliminating the very destinations that would make this system effective.

Why Heavy Rail Matters
Light rail is not sufficient for this corridor. Heavy rail offers:

Speed: Grade-separated tracks mean no stopping at traffic lights
Capacity: Ability to move thousands of people per hour
Reliability: Not impeded by car traffic or congestion
Climate impact: Only a high-capacity system will provide a real alternative to driving

If we're investing billions in transit infrastructure, we need to build something that actually competes with driving. Light rail on a truncated route won't achieve the ridership, emissions reductions, or economic benefits San Diego needs.

My Ask:

Please restore the Purple Line to its full route from San Ysidro to Sorrento Valley as heavy rail. San Diego deserves a transit system that connects our communities, universities, and job centers—not a half-measure that falls short of our region's potential.

I am committed to staying engaged on this issue and will continue to speak up at SANDAG meetings and through public comment until this is resolved.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
