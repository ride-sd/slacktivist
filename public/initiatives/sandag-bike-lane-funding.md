# Information

SANDAG recently presented a proposed project delivery strategy which withholds construction funding for 2 projects and omits a delivery strategy for 2 more. Request SANDAG make the funding and delivery commitments to complete the EAP!

# Content

Dear SANDAG Chair, Vice Chairs, Members, and Leadership,

Thank you for awarding the Construction contract for the Orange Bikeway! This critical project addresses SANDAG’s Safety Focus Network – 6% of the regional transportation network that accounts for 54% of fatal or serious injury crashes, and it closes critical gaps in the Regional Active Transportation Network along with the Central Bikeway.


With those 2 projects in construction, I am writing to express support for the remaining 8 Early Action Program projects:

1. Coastal Rail Trail Encinitas: E St to Chesterfield Dr
2. North Park/Mid-City Bikeways: Robinson Bikeway
3. Bayshore Bikeway: Barrio Logan
4. North Park/Mid-City Bikeways: Howard Bikeway
5. Uptown Bikeways: Mission Hills and Old Town Bikeways
6. Inland Rail Trail: Phase 4
7. South Bay to Southeastern
8. Pacific Highway

I want to ensure they are fully funded in the Fiscal Year 2027 budget with no “Holds” on phases or funding returned. The urgent need for these projects cannot be overstated; nearly all address the Safety Focus Network and fill dangerous gaps that currently discourage people from walking and biking.

With amazing EAP progress in recent years, SANDAG must keep the momentum going with a Fiscal Year 2027 budget that fully funds any shortfalls to complete the remaining 8 EAP projects!

Best,
