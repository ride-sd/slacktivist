# Introduction

Dear {{recipient}},

I am writing to advocate for increased affordable housing development in our community.

# The Problem

The housing crisis affects working families, seniors, and young professionals who are being priced out of our neighborhoods.

Rent prices have increased by over 40% in the past five years while wages remain stagnant. Families are spending more than half their income on housing, and essential workers cannot afford to live in the communities they serve.

# Personal Experience

# Our Demands

We call for the construction of 500 new affordable housing units over the next three years, rent stabilization measures, and incentives for developers who include affordable units.
