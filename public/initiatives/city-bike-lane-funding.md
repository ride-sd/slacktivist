Dear Councilmember Whitburn,

I am writing to request your support in ensuring several long-delayed bicycle and pedestrian projects—originally funded in SANDAG’s 2013 Early Action Program—receive the funding and prioritization necessary to advance. Most of these projects lie within your district, yet they were not included in SANDAG’s recently adopted project delivery strategies.

Some projects face administrative barriers such as unresolved temporary construction easements, while Mission Hills/Old Town still lacks construction funding and may require up to $10 million. Two EAP projects have been omitted entirely. These projects already received ATP funding and were promised to the community more than a decade ago.

Delivering them is crucial to meeting the City’s and region’s Vision Zero, Climate Action Plan, and mode-shift goals. Every year of delay undermines safety, sustainability, and mobility commitments.
We ask that you:

1. Advocate for SANDAG to fully fund and deliver every remaining 2013 EAP project.
2. Press for expedited construction and resolution of easement-related delays.
3. Ensure that the missing EAP projects are restored and advanced without further deferral.


Your leadership is essential to ensuring these long-promised improvements are delivered for the residents who rely on safe, sustainable transportation options.
Thank you for your support.
