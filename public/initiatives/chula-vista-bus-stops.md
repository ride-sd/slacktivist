# Information

Chula Vista is home to many MTS bus routes. Residents love to use the bus to get around town or to visit Downtown San Diego.

Many of these stops, however, are not inviting for people to ride transit. More people would be using the system if it was safe and dignified.

Chula Vista’s Mayor is John McCann, and he also represents Chula Vista on the MTS Board of Directors. Are you a Chula Vista resident?

**Tell Mayor McCann to improve the bus stops!**

Honorable Mayor McCann,

I am a Chula Vista resident writing to request if you can improve the bus stop at {{bus_stop}}. I love riding the bus and I know many more people would too, but bus stops must be safe and dignified.

There are many benefits to the City when people ride the bus:

Reduced traffic on our local roads

Riders have more disposable income that is spend on local businesses

Reduced emissions and cleaner air quality.

Please improve the bus stops. Thank you!
