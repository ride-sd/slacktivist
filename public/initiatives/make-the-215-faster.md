# Information

The 215 rapid bus between SDSU and downtown is one of the highest ridership lines. But because of insufficient infrastructure the buses are always delayed and subject to traffic.

Lets tell city council and MTS to do something about it!

# Content

Dear City Councilmembers, MTS Board Members, and SANDAG Leadership,

I’m writing to urge urgent action to improve MTS Route 215—San Diego’s highest-ridership bus line and the closest thing we have to true rapid transit.

The 215 is the transit lifeline for Mid-City, SDSU, and Downtown, linking dense, historically underserved communities along El Cajon Blvd to jobs, school, healthcare, and opportunity—but even with some transit priority in place, it’s still too slow and unreliable because the most important rapid features are incomplete or inconsistently implemented. What was once envisioned as an approximately 30-minute end-to-end rapid route now routinely takes closer to 50 minutes, costing riders time, dignity, and access.

The 215 does not need to be reinvented. It needs to be finished.

We urge you to do the following:
• Commit to a 30-minute end-to-end peak travel time, with clear performance targets and accountability.
• Close every current bus-lane gap and restripe the corridor to NACTO standards so the 215 runs in continuous, red-painted, 24/7 bus-only lanes, supported by camera enforcement—ensuring the Rapid 215 never operates in mixed traffic.
• Implement all-door boarding, as originally promised when the route was being planned, to reduce dwell time and speed up service at every stop.
• Expand Transit Signal Priority (TSP) to every intersection that doesn’t have it, and make it always active and truly preemptive, so buses reliably move through signals instead of waiting through full cycles.

These are practical, proven upgrades that would immediately improve reliability and speed while advancing San Diego’s climate goals, equity commitments, and Vision Zero priorities. With low car ownership rates in Mid-City and among SDSU students, and major planning efforts already underway, the timing is right to finally deliver on the promise of the Rapid 215.

San Diegans deserve a bus line that functions like rapid transit—not one that gets trapped in the same congestion as cars.

Thank you for your leadership, and I urge you to take action now to Finish the Rapid 215.

Sincerely,
