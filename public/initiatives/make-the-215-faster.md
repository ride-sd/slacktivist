# Information

The 215 rapid bus between SDSU and downtown is one of the highest ridership lines. But because of insufficient infrastructure the buses are always delayed and subject to traffic.

Lets tell city council and MTS to do something about it!

# Content

Dear City Councilmembers, MTS Board Members, and SANDAG Leadership,

I’m urging you to take immediate action to improve MTS Route 215—San Diego’s highest-ridership bus line and closest thing to true Bus Rapid Transit.

The 215 connects dense, underserved communities along El Cajon Blvd to Downtown and SDSU. It has dedicated lanes and transit signal priority in places, but remains unreliable due to infrequent service, delays, and gaps in infrastructure.

To unlock its full potential, we urge you to:
• Increase frequency to every 10 minutes or better;
• Extend bus-only lanes from Fairmount to SDSU;
• Close gaps in bus lanes on Park Blvd;
• Install transit signal priority at every El Cajon Blvd intersection;
• Repave El Cajon Blvd for a smoother, more dignified ride.

These are smart, attainable upgrades that would advance San Diego’s climate, equity, and transit goals. Let’s make the 215 a model for what great bus service should be.

Sincerely,
