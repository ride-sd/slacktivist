# Information

Last month, it was announced that NCTD is planning to enter a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the state to test hydrogen fuel cell multiple unit trains (“ZEMUs”) on the Sprinter, in addition to plans to run these trains on the LOSSAN corridor for the Sprinter and Coaster. While the Sprinter has been struggling with ridership and mechanical issues, hydrogen trains will not provide a fix and are inappropriate for a high frequency line like the Sprinter. Speak out against hydrogen trains in general public comment, and call on NCTD to reject the MOU and plan for electrification instead.

Dear NCTD Board,

I am writing in today because I am concerned about NCTD and the state’s plans to run hydrogen fuel cell trains on the Sprinter. These trains could lead to less reliable and frequent service, increasing traffic and pollution. NCTD must make investments that grow ridership and increase transit access in North County.

Hydrogen trains deployed in Germany have failed, leading to widespread service disruptions due to mechanical issues and fuel shortages. After extensive deployment of hydrogen trains, Germany has halted hydrogen train investments and is replacing most of its hydrogen train service with electric ones. Hydrogen trains will not fix the Sprinter’s reliability issues.

Hydrogen trains have higher operating costs than electric trains, NCTD is already struggling with hydrogen that is more expensive than expected. The state may be paying for fuel in the short term, but once that ends, will high costs lead to service cuts?

Hydrogen also has unique hazards - it is significantly more explosive and prone to leaks than diesel or natural gas. In the short history of hydrogen buses we have seen several catastrophic bus fires in the past few years - what precautions will be taken to prevent this?

Hydrogen trains are less green than made out to be. More than 95% of hydrogen on the market comes from fossil fuels and produces greenhouse gases. Meanwhile, electrolytic (“green”) hydrogen uses at least 3x more energy than directly powering trains with overhead wires - leading to more environmental impacts and inherently higher costs. With growing energy demand from data centers and cuts to federal hydrogen funding, will reliable green hydrogen even be available? Finally, if hydrogen trains lead to service disruptions - as they have in Germany - more people will drive instead of taking the train, creating more air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

By contrast, overhead electrification is an efficient, tried and true technology with inherently lower fuel and maintenance costs and faster acceleration than diesel or hydrogen. Caltrain has seen some of the highest ridership growth in the country due to the faster and more frequent service unlocked by electrification. NCTD needs to invest in growth, with faster, more frequent, more convenient service if it wants the Sprinter to regain riders. If NCTD wants to widen the 78, adding traffic and pollution, they must expand Sprinter service.

I urge NCTD to reconsider an MOU with the state and to plan for electrification of the Sprinter.

Sincerely,
